# Welcome!

If you're interested in projects I've worked on, you've come to the right place. I'm using this space to present a curated selection of my projects, and to share some insight into how I approached tackling them.

As for what you can expect to find, most of my work ranges from solving small, niche problems and workflow hindrances, to more complex real-time systems, or just exploring new ideas and satisfying my curiosity. Language-wise, I tend to pick what I perceive to be the best language for the task at hand. For the last couple of years, this has largely been Python and C#.

Since I typically don't publish on Github, I'm still preparing more of my fun projects to share with the world. For an overview of what I have prepared so far, please see the projects page. Right now, I'm focused on my Rust journey, and I hope to have something cool to share from that soon!

Thanks for stopping by!
